        <h2>Proof of Ownership is Magical</h2>
        <h5>From gold monetary ledgers to banks to blockchain technology, true proof of ownership is arguably one of the most magical things in the world.</h4>

        A long time ago, gold was the main media of exchange in the world, together with silver and bronze. These two were used for smaller transactions as they had less value since they were easier to find. Gold on the other hand, was used for larger transactions and had more value.        
      </p>
      <p>
        That system worked great, except for a fundamental problem with precious metals as a medium of exchange: transportation. Transportation quickly became an issue especially with larger transactions mostly due to the weight of them and they were slowly losing value, making people use more metals for each transaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that was fine for a long time, except for if you wanted to buy a large load of cargo, for example. The amount of gold it cost to purchase such a thing was too big to simply give a coin, or even carrying a cart full of it, no, we needed a better method. Enter the first monetary ledgers.
      </p>

      <h4>Ledgers</h4>
      <p>
        The way they worked was super simple, you own say 10 tons of gold and need to pay 5 tons to your friend, instead of giving him the gold, you would write down that, out of your 10 tons of gold, 5 were his and 5 were yours. Now your friend could buy 2 tons of gold worth of a product and you would update the ledger to say you own 5 tons, your friend owns 3 tons and the merchant owns 2.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was an amazing system for the time, the only thing is everyone had to know how much everyone had, but this wasn’t a problem since only the small amount of people rich enough to need this system existed at the time, these were kings, queens, large merchants and such.
      </p>
      <p>
        The introduction of paper money changed the way these ledgers worked, but the general idea was the same, but it still had some issues.. Enter banks and digital money as we know today.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone has a bank account nowadays, and what are bank accounts but monetary ledgers, recording what each person has and, when a transfer occurs, the ledger, the bank and the two parties now agree the sender has x amount less in their account and the receiver has x amount more…
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course the history and functionality I presented here are way oversimplified, but these are the basics of ledgers. But what does this have to do with proof of ownership?

      <h4>Proof of Ownership</h4>
      <p>
        It’s simple: proof of ownership is magical. The invention of blockchain technology has now allowed the concept of proof of ownership be explored to its full extent and it has shown us what real proof of ownership is.
      </p>
      <p>
        Blockchain technology and crypto use what’s called private keys, each wallet/account has a private key associated with it, each coin you send, each contract you approve, each yield farm harvest or each NFT mint you make, you are creating a transaction and signing it with your private key.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since each wallet has only one private key, it’s safe to say that it is yours and only yours, it’s safe to say that each transaction signed with said private key is a transaction signed by you and you only.
      </p>
      <p>
        With that in mind, you can now say that, as long as you have them in a non-custodial wallet, you <b>own</b> your coins and that you <b>own</b> your tokens. You can also say, subsequently, that you <b>own</b> your NFT, because what is an NFT if not a token, a non-fungible one, but a token nonetheless.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main difference between the blockchain ledgers and the antique gold ledgers, is that now all the nodes within the network can truly verify you own a coin, or a token for example. As per the old system, anyone could theoretically write that they own all the gold in the world, and even banks can change their own ledgers if they want to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now is the first time in history you can <b>actually</b> verify someone <b>actually</b> owns a certain digital asset. Your Bitcoin, your BNB, your Ether, your Bored Ape, your Lazy Lion, whatever you want, you <b>own</b> it, it’s yours and it cannot be taken from you without you signing a transaction saying so.
      </p>

      <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>
        This topic has always interested me, but especially now with bitcoin and blockchain, and especially now that I'm personally more interested in NFTs, I'm realizing more and more how much proof of ownership is magical and how great things can come out of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Non-Fungible Tokens are one of the best examples of this. When you buy an NFT, you aren’t buying the image, the song, video, etc… you’re buying a unique token that is not fungible in any way, meaning it’s unique to itself and cannot be replicated. This information is locked and public in the blockchain for everybody to see, which makes it counterfeit proof.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m not talking about the monkeys, or the lion, or whatever your drawing is, I'm talking about how you can use this for so many things like say an entrance ticket to a show or a ticket to a game. It can be your own digital identity and it’s truly, truly magical…
